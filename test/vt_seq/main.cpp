// Tools will have dumb shit like rewriting progress bars, so we'll need to parse the terminal sequences and track which lines are in use by which process
// Since we access from thread, we'll need to provide an ongoing accessor lock to print throug printImpl rather than going through print directly
// Those terminal sequences will need to be translated to alternate the output lines properly (maybe prefix them too)
